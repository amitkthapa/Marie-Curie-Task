# Marie-Curie-Task

Future Improvements:

- Add a DI container to handle all the dependencies(Perhaps Autofac)
- Separate OpenWeatherApiController to it's own Class library project, so that it's modular and can be used else where
- The solution is far from perfect, it can do with some refactoring 
- More robust error handling and error logging
